# HTML Laboratory Assignments

## Brief Description
This repository contains solutions to a series of HTML exercises and laboratory assignments, culminating in a personal website project. The assignments cover fundamental HTML concepts, text formatting, links, lists, images, media, semantic HTML, forms, tables, accessibility, and SEO.

## Steps to Run the Project
To view the HTML pages, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):** If you obtained these files from a version control system (like Git), clone the repository to your local machine.

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:** Open your file explorer or terminal and go to the directory where you've saved these files.

3.  **Open HTML files:** Simply double-click on any of the `.html` files (e.g., `exercise1.html`, `mini_projects/contact_us.html`, `capstone_project/index.html`) to open them in your default web browser.

No special server or setup is required as these are static HTML files.
